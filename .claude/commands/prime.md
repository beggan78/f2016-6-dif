Take extra care to put logic where it belongs instead of where it's convenient.
Reuse existing logic where possible. Favor updating existing logic over writing new very similar logic.
Please apply software principles like:
DRY
KISS

In case you run into unforeseen problems with the plan, please pause and let me know so we can work it out together.
