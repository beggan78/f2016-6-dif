First read the documentation in the following files:
README.md
src/game/README.md

For changes to the game logic:
When making changes, make sure to first understand the separation of concerns between files in the `src/game` directory.
Also read the files App.js and GameScreen.js.

Take extra care to put logic where it belongs instead of where it's convenient.
Please apply software principles like:
DRY
KISS
Separation of Concerns
Single Responsibility Principle

In case you run into unforeseen problems with the plan, please pause and let me know so we can work it out together.
