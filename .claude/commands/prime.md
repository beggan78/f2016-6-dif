First read the documentation in the following files:
CLAUDE.md

When making changes, make sure to first understand the separation of concerns between files in the `src/game` directory.
Also read the files App.js and GameScreen.js.

Take extra care to put logic where it belongs instead of where it's convenient.
Reuse existing logic where possible. Favor updating existing logic over writing new very similar logic.
Please apply software principles like:
DRY
KISS

In case you run into unforeseen problems with the plan, please pause and let me know so we can work it out together.
