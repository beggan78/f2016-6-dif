# DIF F16-6 Coach

A mobile-first web application designed for coaching youth soccer teams. This app helps manage player rotations, track playing time, and maintain fair substitution patterns during games with 5v5 formations.

## Overview

DIF F16-6 Coach is built specifically for managing a soccer team of 14 players where 6-7 players are selected for each game. The app supports both 6-player and 7-player squad configurations, with intelligent rotation systems to ensure fair playing time distribution.

- **Flexible Team Formation**: Supports both pair-based (7 players) and individual position-based (6 players) formations
- **Real-time Game Management**: Dual timers track match time and substitution intervals
- **Automated Substitution Planning**: AI-powered recommendations for optimal player rotations
- **Fair Time Distribution**: Comprehensive time tracking ensures equitable playing opportunities
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface designed for sideline use
- **Persistent State**: Game state is preserved through browser refreshes

## Game Format

### Field Setup
- **5v5 Format**: 1 goalie + 2 defenders + 2 attackers per team
