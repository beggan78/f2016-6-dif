# Authentication System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a secure login/logout system with best practices for the Sport Wizard application. Add authentication options to the hamburger menu with secure sign-in and account creation functionality.

## Phase 1: Supabase Client Setup & User Context

### Task 1.1: Create Supabase Client Configuration
**Prompt to Claude:** "Set up the Supabase client for the React application. Create a new file `/src/lib/supabase.js` that initializes the Supabase client using the environment variables from `.env`. Import and configure the client with the project URL and anon key. Follow Supabase best practices for client setup."

### Task 1.2: Environment Variables Setup
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the Supabase credentials from the existing `.env` file. Ensure the variables are named according to React conventions (REACT_APP_ prefix). Update the Supabase client to use these properly prefixed environment variables."

### Task 1.3: Authentication Context Implementation
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create an authentication context at `/src/contexts/AuthContext.js`. Implement a React context that manages user authentication state including login, logout, signup, and session management. Include loading states, error handling, and user profile data. Use Supabase auth methods and follow React context best practices."

### Task 1.4: Auth Provider Integration
**Prompt to Claude:** "Wrap the main App component with the AuthProvider. Modify `/src/App.js` to include the authentication context provider so that all components have access to authentication state. Ensure this doesn't break any existing functionality."

## Phase 2: Authentication Components

### Task 2.1: Login Form Component
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create a login form component at `/src/components/auth/LoginForm.js`. Include email and password fields with proper validation, loading states, error handling, and accessibility features. Use the existing UI components from `/src/components/shared/UI.js` for consistency. Implement form submission with Supabase authentication."

### Task 2.2: Signup Form Component
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create a signup form component at `/src/components/auth/SignupForm.js`. Include email, password, and confirm password fields with validation rules. Add name field for user profile creation. Implement proper error handling, loading states, and use existing UI components. Handle Supabase user registration and profile creation."

### Task 2.3: Password Reset Component
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create a password reset component at `/src/components/auth/PasswordReset.js`. Implement email-based password reset functionality using Supabase auth. Include proper form validation, success/error states, and user feedback. Use existing UI components for consistency."

### Task 2.4: Authentication Modal System
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create an authentication modal system that can display login, signup, or password reset forms. Create `/src/components/auth/AuthModal.js` that manages the different authentication states and transitions between them. Use the existing modal patterns from the codebase."

## Phase 3: Hamburger Menu Integration

### Task 3.1: Enhance Hamburger Menu with Authentication
**Prompt to Claude:** "Modify `/src/components/shared/HamburgerMenu.js` to include authentication functionality. Add conditional login/logout buttons based on authentication state. For unauthenticated users, show 'Login' option. For authenticated users, show 'Profile' and 'Logout' options. Maintain the existing menu structure and styling."

### Task 3.2: Authentication State Integration
**Prompt to Claude:** "Update the hamburger menu to use the authentication context. Display the user's name when logged in, and handle the login/logout actions. Ensure the menu items are properly conditionally rendered based on authentication status."

## Phase 4: User Profile Management

### Task 4.1: Profile Display Component
**Prompt to Claude:** "Create a profile display component at `/src/components/auth/ProfileDisplay.js`. Show user information including name, email, and account details. Use existing UI components and follow the app's design patterns. Include edit functionality for user profile data."

### Task 4.2: Profile Integration
**Prompt to Claude:** "Integrate the profile functionality into the main app navigation. Create a profile view that can be accessed from the hamburger menu. Ensure it follows the existing view pattern used in the app (CONFIG, GAME, STATS, etc.)."

## Phase 5: Protected Features & Data Integration

### Task 5.1: Authentication Guards
**Prompt to Claude:** "Implement authentication guards that protect certain features. Add checks to ensure only authenticated users can access specific functionality. Display appropriate messages or redirect to login for unauthenticated users attempting to access protected features."

### Task 5.2: User Data Association
**Prompt to Claude:** "Begin associating user data with the authenticated user. Start by saving team configurations and match data to the user's profile. Implement data synchronization between local storage and Supabase database for authenticated users."

## Phase 6: Testing & Polish

### Task 6.1: Authentication Flow Testing
**Prompt to Claude:** "Test the complete authentication flow including signup, login, logout, and password reset. Ensure all error states are handled properly and the user experience is smooth. Test with various scenarios including network failures and invalid credentials."

### Task 6.2: UI/UX Polish
**Prompt to Claude:** "Polish the authentication UI to match the existing app design. Ensure loading states, error messages, and success feedback are consistent with the app's style. Test the authentication flow on different screen sizes and ensure responsive design."

### Task 6.3: Security Review
**Prompt to Claude:** "Review the authentication implementation for security best practices. Ensure proper session management, secure password handling, and protection against common auth vulnerabilities. Verify that sensitive data is not logged or exposed."

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Requirements
