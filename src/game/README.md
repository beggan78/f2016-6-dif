## Design Principles

### 1. Pure Functions
All state transition logic is implemented as pure functions that:
- Take current state as input
- Return new state as output
- Have no side effects
- Are predictable and testable
- Enable features like undo, preview, and animation calculation

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Logic**: Pure business rules and state calculations
- **Handlers**: Event handling and UI integration with domain-based organization
- **UI Utilities**: Rendering support functions separated from business logic
- **Animation**: Visual transition management and timing
- **Queue**: Player rotation and ordering algorithms
- **State Management**: React state updates and UI integration (handled in components)

### 3. Animation-Logic Separation
The animation system works by:
1. Capturing "before" state positions
2. Calculating "after" state using pure logic functions
3. Computing visual differences and animation requirements
4. Orchestrating timing and applying state changes

This separation allows logic changes without breaking animations and vice versa.

### 4. Domain-Based Organization
- **Handler factories** organized by game domain (field positions, goalie, substitutions, etc.)
- **Consistent naming** reflecting actual responsibilities rather than technical implementation
- **Dependency injection** for testability and flexibility
- **Single responsibility** principle applied to each module

### 5. Universal Interaction Patterns
- **Scroll detection** integrated into all long press interactions to prevent accidental triggers
- **Consistent event handling** through universal `useLongPressWithScrollDetection` hook
- **React hooks compliance** with proper separation of callback creation and hook usage
- **DRY principle** applied to eliminate duplicated interaction logic

# Key Concepts

## Game State
The central `gameState` object contains:
- `formation`: Current player positions and formation structure
- `allPlayers`: Complete player data with stats and status
- `rotationQueue`: Order of players for substitutions
- `teamMode`: PAIRS_7, INDIVIDUAL_6, or INDIVIDUAL_7
- `nextPlayerIdToSubOut`, `nextNextPlayerIdToSubOut`: Rotation tracking
- `playersToHighlight`: Players to show glow effects
- Various timing and metadata fields

## Team Modes
Three supported team modes:
- **PAIRS_7**: 7-player pairs mode (2 field pairs + 1 substitute pair + goalie)
- **INDIVIDUAL_6**: 6-player individual mode (4 field players + 1 substitute + goalie)  
- **INDIVIDUAL_7**: 7-player individual mode (4 field players + 2 substitutes + goalie)

## Animation Orchestration
The unified animation system:
1. Uses `captureAllPlayerPositions()` to snapshot current layout
2. Applies pure logic functions to calculate new state
3. Uses `calculateAllPlayerAnimations()` to determine movement distances
4. Orchestrates timing with `animateStateChange()` for smooth transitions

---

# Design Patterns

## Pure Function Architecture
All state transitions follow this pattern:
```javascript
export const calculateOperation = (gameState, ...params) => {
  // Validate inputs
  if (/* invalid conditions */) {
    console.warn('Validation message');
    return gameState; // Return unchanged state
  }
  
  // Calculate new state
  const newFormation = { ...gameState.formation };
  const newPlayers = gameState.allPlayers.map(player => {
    // Player-specific updates
    return updatedPlayer;
  });
  
  // Return new complete state
  return {
    ...gameState,
    formation: newFormation,
    allPlayers: newPlayers,
    playersToHighlight: changedPlayerIds
  };
};
```

## Time Calculation Pattern
Player time tracking follows this approach:
1. Calculate time spent in current stint: `currentTime - lastStintStartTime`
2. Add stint time to appropriate counters (field, sub, goalie, role-specific)
3. Update status and reset stint timer: `lastStintStartTimeEpoch = currentTime`
4. Respect pause state: skip calculations when `isSubTimerPaused = true`

## Error Handling Strategy
- Validate inputs and return unchanged state for invalid operations
- Log warnings for debugging without breaking game flow
- Graceful degradation: prefer partial success over complete failure
- No exceptions thrown from pure functions

---

# Usage Guidelines

## Adding New Game Operations
1. **Create pure logic function** in `gameStateLogic.js`:
   ```javascript
   export const calculateNewOperation = (gameState, ...params) => {
     // Return new game state without modifying input
     return { ...gameState, /* changes */ };
   };
   ```

2. **Create or extend handler factory** in appropriate `handlers/` file:
   ```javascript
   export const createNewOperationHandlers = (dependencies) => {
     const handleNewOperation = () => {
       animateStateChange(
         gameStateFactory(),
         calculateNewOperation,
         applyStateChanges,
         setAnimationState,
         setHideNextOffIndicator,
         setRecentlySubstitutedPlayers
       );
     };
     
     return { handleNewOperation };
   };
   ```

3. **Integrate handlers in GameScreen** with dependency injection:
   ```javascript
   const newOperationHandlers = React.useMemo(() =>
     createNewOperationHandlers(dependencies),
     [dependencies]
   );
   ```

## Adding New Long Press Interactions
1. **Add callback to appropriate handler factory** (e.g., `fieldPositionHandlers.js`):
   ```javascript
   const newPositionCallback = () => {
     // Handle new position interaction
   };
   
   return { ...existingCallbacks, newPositionCallback };
   ```

2. **Extend `useFieldPositionHandlers` hook** to include new callback:
   ```javascript
   const newPositionEvents = useLongPressWithScrollDetection(
     fieldPositionCallbacks.newPositionCallback || (() => {}), 500
   );
   ```

3. **Use in formation renderer**:
   ```javascript
   <div {...longPressHandlers.newPositionEvents}>
     {/* Position content */}
   </div>
   ```

## Extending Team Modes
- Add new formation constants to `constants/playerConstants.js`
- Update position utilities in `utils/positionUtils.js` 
- Extend animation position mappings in `animationSupport.js`
- Add formation-specific logic to substitution manager

## Queue Integration Example
```javascript
import { createRotationQueue } from './queue/rotationQueue';
import { createPlayerLookup } from '../utils/playerUtils';

// Create queue with player lookup for inactive status checking
const queueManager = createRotationQueue(
  gameState.rotationQueue, 
  createPlayerLookup(gameState.allPlayers)
);

// Initialize to separate active/inactive players
queueManager.initialize();

// Perform operations
queueManager.rotatePlayer(substitutedPlayerId);

// Update game state
const newGameState = {
  ...gameState,
  rotationQueue: queueManager.toArray()
};
```

## Animation Integration Example
```javascript
import { animateStateChange } from './animation/animationSupport';
import { calculatePositionSwitch } from './logic/gameStateLogic';

const handlePositionSwitch = (player1Id, player2Id) => {
  animateStateChange(
    createGameState(),
    (state) => calculatePositionSwitch(state, player1Id, player2Id),
    (newState) => {
      setFormation(newState.formation);
      setAllPlayers(newState.allPlayers);
      // ... update other state
    },
    setAnimationState,
    setHideNextOffIndicator,
    setRecentlySubstitutedPlayers
  );
};
```

- Substitute position: `substitute` (single player)
- Goalie: `goalie` (single position)
- Individual player substitutions
- Position-based role assignment
- Simple rotation: substituted player moves to end
- Next player is always queue[0]

## INDIVIDUAL_7 (7-Player Mode)
- Field positions: `leftDefender`, `rightDefender`, `leftAttacker`, `rightAttacker`
- Substitute positions: `substitute_1`, `substitute_2` (two separate substitutes)
- Goalie: `goalie` (single position)
- Individual player substitutions with rotation
- Inactive player support (players can be temporarily removed from rotation)
- Complex rotation with inactive player support
- Next/next-next tracking for substitute management
- Reactivation puts player at end of queue (lowest priority)

2. **Handler factories** return callbacks and action handlers
3. **React hooks** integrate callbacks with `useLongPressWithScrollDetection` for event handling
4. **Formation renderers** use UI utilities (`ui/`) for consistent styling and behavior
5. **Game logic** (`logic/`) provides pure functions for state transitions
6. **Animation system** (`animation/`) orchestrates visual transitions
7. **Time tracking** (`time/`) manages player stint calculations

# Debugging and Testing

## Testing Pure Functions
All logic functions can be tested in isolation:
```javascript
const testState = {
  formation: { /* test formation */ },
  allPlayers: [ /* test players */ ],
  teamMode: 'INDIVIDUAL_6'
};

const result = calculateSubstitution(testState);
expect(result.formation).toBe(/* expected formation */);
```

## Animation Debugging
```javascript
// Enable debug logging
const animations = calculateAllPlayerAnimations(before, after, teamMode);
console.log('Animation data:', animations);
```

## Queue Debugging
```javascript
console.log('Active queue:', queue.getActiveQueue());
console.log('Inactive players:', queue.getInactivePlayers());
console.log('Next player:', queue.getNextActivePlayer());
```

## Common Issues
- **State inconsistency**: Verify pure functions return consistent results
- **Animation timing**: Ensure duration matches CSS animation timing
- **Queue desync**: Ensure initialize() called after loading state
- **Z-index conflicts**: Check moving direction and z-index classes

This architecture ensures maintainable, testable code with clear separation between business logic, visual presentation, and data management.
